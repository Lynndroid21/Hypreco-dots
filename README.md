I started this project due to the fact I personally have a great distaste for AI in general (more specifically how it's used and the damage it does to society) and many dotfiles I found (some OS like Nyarch as well) come with ai features, so I decided to make my own dots that exclusively do NOT involve AI.

Absolutely zero hate to any of these developers, their work is truly amazing! I just prefer OpenAI or any other AI service to have no part in my system, so I'm making this opinionated pack for people who agree!

# Installation

***REQUIRED:***

* yay (for the future updates that use my own install script for maximum lazy lol.)
* Hyprland (duhh)
* brightnessctl
* flameshot
* hyprpanel
* hyprpaper
* wl-paste
* wl-clipboard
* hyprlock
* hypridle
* fish
* kitty
* rofi
* wlogout
* pipewire
* batsignal
* hyprcursor
* hyprsettings
* caffeine
* hyprsession
* hyprpolkitagent
* pywal
* matugen

*External Dependencies:*

* Docker Desktop (soon to be implemented!)
* Self Hosted Search engine (I use SearXNG, but if there's another one that exists that you wanna use go ahead)
* Kate Advanced text Editor (you can find it on flathub, I highly recommend using it for code edits, it just simplifies your workflow nicely.)

*Other used applications:*

* Localsend
* Brave (most browser callbacks in these files will call for it, but if you use firefox it should auto call for that too.)
* Deezer Desktop (You can use spotify-- ew-- instead of deezer, I personally enjoy deezer more)
* Lazyvim (for those who enjoy terminal file browsing more)
* Dolphin (default file browser used)
* tmux

Most of these dependencies are fairly simple to get running, the real work is inserting certain labels for your specific docker components. Luckily I'm working on making several scripts to automate certain containers to run on startup. This is currently a WIP, so check back in for updates on development!

**Instructions**

simply drag and drop the files/folders you want into the .config folder, reboot and enjoy!

# DISCLAIMER

The sys-updater-hypreco.sh script is currently only built for arch/arch-based distro users! multi-distro support is coming soon! This is an EVOLVING WIP, updates may happen rapidly during the beginning 6 months of this project!
